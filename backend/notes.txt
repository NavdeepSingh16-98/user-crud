/createUser
user will send name and email

we will check if email and name are not empty


we will try to find the user using email in the database


if user already exist , throw error email already  exist

if not , create a user

and send - success, message and user object

/getUsers


no need of any input from user , just use User.find() it will give us all getUsers

return json with success = true , and all users json


/ editUser/:id

in this api user will send id as a url parameter

also user will send a body containing name and email

now we will use findByIdandUpdate(req.params.id,req.body);

similarily to send the json we will send success : true and message:user updated successfully

if fails,

we will send 

success:false, message:error.message

/deleteUser/:id


this api is similar to edit user, here we will use

findByIdandDelete(req.params.id);

response will be same as 

success:true
message:"User deleted successfully"
